-First-order imperative language
-Builds and traverses labeled graphs
-Statically typed programs
-snapshotting graphs to graphviz

Eg building graph

nlabel l : Int default 0;
elabel g : Bool defalult False

node x;
node y;
edge e : x-> y;
x.l = 5;
e.g = True;

fun name(x : Node, depth : Int) : Nothing
{
	if x.d=0 then {
	
}
}

Types:
-Label types are not allowed to be used as types in GraMa programs unless where nlabel or elabel is declared

Expressions and Statements
-Statements can have expressions, expressions cannot have statements
-Function calls that return nothing are statements, with calls are

Statements:
-Each file should be a statement
-Statements cannot have nested functions
